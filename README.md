## hwpplayer1's notes

* I want to write some free software within @masscollabs and its subprojects as in organizations.

* I am familiar with programming but I need some time to gain experience and muscle memory.

* I love helping people and that makes me happy.

## hwpplayer1's prefered licenses for his own works

* I prefer strong copyleft licenses for my own works like GNU GPL v3+ and GNU Affero GPL v3+ .

* But when I join other people's projects I accept any Free Software and Open Source license.
